- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexhwanggg
- 👀 I’m interested in simply learning as much as I can. I am very new to coding and I want to be exposed to it all, so I can figure out where my strengths lie.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development through a bootcamp starting at the end of this year. I've been self-taught until now and I feel it best to further my growth with peers and professionals. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on EVERYTHING.
- 📫 How to reach me : alexhwang96@gmail.com
